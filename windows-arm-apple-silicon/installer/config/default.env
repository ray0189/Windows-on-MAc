# Default environment configuration for the Windows ARM installer
#
# Copy this file to `installer/config/local.env` and adjust any variables
# to suit your environment.  The `one_click_installer.sh` script sources
# this file first, then overrides with any variables present in
# `local.env`.  Leaving variables commented here retains their default.

## Target machine identifier
# TARGET_MACHINE="m1-mac-mini"

## Repository root detection
# REPO_ROOT is automatically detected relative to the installer script if
# left unset.  You can override it here to point at the top level of
# your windows-arm-apple-silicon checkout.  Useful when running the
# steps manually.
# REPO_ROOT="/path/to/windows-arm-apple-silicon"

## Build and output directories
# Directory where intermediate build artifacts are stored.  Defaults to
# "$REPO_ROOT/build".
# BUILD_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/build"

# Directory where final outputs and staging files are stored.  Defaults
# to "$REPO_ROOT/build/staging".
# OUTPUT_DIR="$REPO_ROOT/build/staging"

## EDK2 build target
# Set this to "RELEASE" or "DEBUG" to control the optimisation level of
# the AppleSilicon EDK2 firmware build.  Release builds are smaller and
# faster; debug builds include additional logging.  Defaults to
# "RELEASE".
# DEFAULT_EDK2_BUILD_TARGET="RELEASE"

## Minimum supported macOS version
# The scripts will warn if the installed macOS version is below this
# threshold.  Set to the minimum version you have tested.  Example:
# MINIMUM_MACOS_VERSION="12.0"

## Additional environment overrides
# You may also define SELECTED_DISK or WINDOWS_ISO_PATH here to avoid
# prompts, though using the interactive prompts is strongly recommended.
# SELECTED_DISK="disk4"
# WINDOWS_ISO_PATH="/path/to/Windows11_ARM.iso"
# Specify a direct URL to download the Windows 11 ARM ISO.  If set, the
# prepare script will offer to download the ISO automatically.  Leave
# commented to disable auto-download.
# WINDOWS_ISO_URL=""
